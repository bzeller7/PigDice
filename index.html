        <h2>Pig Dice Rules</h2>
        <div id="rules">
            On a turn, a player rolls the die repeatedly. <br>
            The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, adding up the numbers rolled on the die.<br>
             However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's turn is over and any points they have accumulated during this turn are forfeited. 
            <br>
            Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe out your entire score, just the total earned during that particular roll.
            <br> <br>
            A player can also choose to hold (stop rolling) if they do not want to take a chance of rolling a 1 and losing all of their points from this turn. <br>
            If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that turn are added to his or her score.
            <br>
            When a player reaches a total of 100 or more points, the game ends and that player is the winner.
